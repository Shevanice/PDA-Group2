Description: The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive game that challenges players to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. With each guess, the game provides helpful hints telling the player whether to guess higher or lower â€” until the correct number is found.
This game demonstrates several key programming concepts: Random Number Generation to create unpredictability in each game. Classes and Objects for a structured and reusable code design.
Exception Handling to gracefully manage invalid input. Descriptive Analytics such as: Total number of guesses per game, Average guesses across multiple rounds, And the best (lowest) number of guesses.
The player's scores are stored and displayed after each game session, encouraging improvement and replayability. This game runs continuously until the player chooses to exit, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience.
